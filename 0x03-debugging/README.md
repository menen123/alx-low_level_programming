0x03-debugging
under the folder name 0x03-debugging their are different source files which are modified or even commented on to certain extent to have a desirable output.in order to makek the excution of existing codes possible a header file called main.h is used.this file contains the prototypes of functions and undeclared integers so that they could be used later on in the coding process.the files that are included are namely

1.0-main.c
in this file the existing cfile whichwas alreaady provided(main.c) is used to test out if the function output is valid or not.it is done by first defining this function inside the header file and then using that fuction only and not its definition to evaluate the validity of the answer in file main.c.

2.1-main.c
here the file contains an existing code which had an infinity loop condition and this infinity loop condition cause and how to solve it is listed out in the line where the problem is expected to have been caused.

3.2-largest_number.c
in thsi file provided three numbers a fuction that puts out the largest value is created using the header file.the definition for this function is done insidethe header file and by using include the header file contents were usesd to make the funciton work in the 2-largest_number.c file.
